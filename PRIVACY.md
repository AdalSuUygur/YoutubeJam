Last updated: 2026-02-25

## Purpose
YoutubeJam is a Chrome extension designed to synchronize YouTube video playback (play, pause, seek, and video change) between users in the same room.

## Data Usage
The extension processes limited technical data required for synchronization:

- Room name entered by the user
- YouTube video URL
- Playback state (play/pause)
- Playback position (timestamp)

This data is used only to provide real-time synchronization between participants.

## Data Collection
YoutubeJam does not collect personally identifiable information such as names, emails, passwords, or financial data.

## Data Sharing
Synchronization data is transmitted only to other users connected to the same room through a socket connection.

## Storage
Basic room information may be stored locally using Chrome storage. No tracking or analytics systems are used.

## Third Parties
YoutubeJam does not sell user data and does not use data for advertising or analytics purposes.
